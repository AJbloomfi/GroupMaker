Installation Run the Program:
To use this software, first the user will download the python file and download the CSV files attached to this document.
The user can also use their own csv file that they have created but must be formatted in a specific way. 
Below will describe how to format the csv file properly for the software to work as necessary.
From there, depending on the type of computer you have, the user will have to move these files to their account on the 
UMW computer science server and access them on the terminal command window. For Mac users, you must open up the terminal command,
SSH and log into the CS server, and then run the files using “python3 ./pythonfilename” in the same directory as the csv files. 
For Windows users, you must log into the CS servers through PuTTY and then run the files using “python3 ./pythonfilename” in the same 
directory as the csv files.


Creating Google survey:
In order for the software to work correctly, the first question the user must ask is for the name and 
the last question must be "Blacklist"

Blacklist - Means, if the student does not prefer to work with a specific student.

Questions should be formated as:

What is your ________?

Example questions:

What is your first name?
What is your major?
What is your age?
What is your favorite car?
etc...



Example of the csv produced by a Google Survey:

Timestamp, What is your name?, What is your major?, What is your favorite car?, What is your favorite food?, Blacklist
